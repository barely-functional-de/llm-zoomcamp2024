This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine\"s service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!\"}\n",

It\\\"s a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It\\\"s pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. \"lime\") they need to be disposed of and replaced.\"}\n",

I have cut the holess much bigger and it\"s better, but still needs a manual defrost. This last time I made the holes enormous, so lets see if that helps.

Before you purchase this model, however, you should read my other comments here, along with some of the other notes. This washer is a rugged little machine, which is made in America to serve principally in janitorial operations as a mop head and rag washer for a janitor\"s closet. As such, it can be a very cheap and rugged alternative for home use, but IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WASHER, in the modern sense. It is much more akin to antique washers, as it is really just a pail with a timer controlled agitator and a drain hose. That\"s it. You have to fill it with water, drain it, fill it again to rinse, drain it, maybe rinse again, and all by hand, and then wring out your clothes and dry them.\"}\n",

What is the difference between this PUR filter 4396841 for $35, the cheaper Pur PBSS one for $29 or the 4396710 for $35???\", \"answer\": \"If all the filters are original PUR* replacement filters, the filter medium will be the same. Someone has posted that the PBSS filter is inferior to the others, but I see no data to back up that assertion. The difference is in the amount of water they can filter before recommended replacement and the flow rate. The \"universal\" PBSS filter is rated at 100gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396710 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396841 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.85GPH flow rate. Strangely, both the 100 & 200 gal. capacity models are recommended for 6 months replacement. You would think the 200gal. models would last longer. Some whirlpool refrigerators offer what\\\"s called \"fast-fill\" systems, which dispense the water almost twice as fast as \"normal\" systems. It stands to reason that the 4396841 would be best if you want/need the higher flow rate. It also stands to reason that the lower flow rate models probably filter better since the cartridges (and presumably the filter mediums) are exactly the same size (educated opinion). I have decided on the 4396710 for my refrigerator. I researched a lot for this answer, I hope it helps.\"}\n",

When i leave in the morning i turn the A/C off anyways so even if it increases the temp and humidity in the apartment i never notice it. Coming home turn the A/C on and fold clothes and everything is good. If it helps you the dryer uses about as much electricity as a hair dryer or a space heater (My kill-a-watt says between 900-1000w during use). The matching washer uses literally a fraction of that. I also use auto dry instead of timed dry and have never had a problem with it.

Yes, I believe it will be able to hold your temperature range of 50 to 55 degrees. It will probably be able to do that without having to disassemble the thermostat too. You will need, however, to monitor the temperature until it gets to your desired range. I have one of those atomic clock things that has an outside temperature transmitter. I just put that transmitter inside the kegerator. Mine keeps track of the temp range in the past 12 hours and resets at midnight each day. I just went down and checked mine. Now, keep in mind that I actually have mine set to keep my beer in the mid 30\\\"s. I like cold beer! Anyway, the range of mine since midnight last night has been between 31 and 38 degrees. It was precisely 33 degrees when I just checked. It holds that pretty consistently day in and day out now that I have my dial set correctly. By the way, it is a rotary dial, with \"colder and warmer\" direction. There is no temp set. So it may take you some trial and error but I think you should be able to get there pretty quickly.

My one suggestion - get the 5 burner if your counter will in any way accommodate it. When we got our induction cook top, I\\\"d never even seen one or knew anyone who had used it. My husband said, \"Get the 5 burner\" - I didn\\\"t want to, as I\\\"d never been short on burners when cooking, even for groups. (I was always running out of oven space so we did get a double oven - reg. sized - LOVE it!) Well, even the sales person didn\\\"t explain to me the advantages of the 5 burner; it\\\"s more than just a burner. With induction, it is more important to match an sizes, but . .more importantly, you can only use \"H\" (the energy boost for rapid heating\" on one burner at a time in a section. On the 4-burner cooktop, there are 2 \"sections\" (I am sure there is a technical term for it) - on the 5 burner, there are 3 sections - so . . you can put more burners on \"H\" at the same time, and yep - I needed to one day when cooking for a crowd. Of course, you make do with what you have - but I sure wish I\\\"d gone w/the 5 burner for the times I need it. And . . I LOVE the \"L\" (lowest) setting - holds things perfectly, and I no longer need to melt choc. over a double boiler. I just put it in the pan on the stove -L setting. And .. I while many pans will work w/induction, I\\\"d recommend the best you can afford. We have been very frugal our entire lives - and did buy Demeyere pots and pans. LOVE them - (even when I had to cook on a coil hot plate while the kitchen was being remodeled.) Worth every penny - and if you get them at Sur LaTable and don\\\"t care for them you can return them.

The other end is rounded as are the sides except for the opening side which is flat. The holding basket for cubes made is directly over the water level compartment so the cubes are very watery and start to melt if not removed immediately. The basket in the water holding compartment directly under the door lid on top of the unit is not cooled except by the cubes that are made and put into the basket by the device. Taking the cubes out of the device and putting them in our freezer as they are made is a small task, but once in the freezer each individual cube freezes solid and to each other also due to their watery condition so you have to use a tool or pick to separate them from each other and any others that were already in the ice cube container in the freezer.

Since the water dispenser was working, I \"tested\" the old icemaker valve by disconnecting the water dispenser valve\"s electrical clip and attached it to the icemaker connection. Then pushing the water dispenser lever on the front of the refrigerator I got no water flow and knew the icemaker valve was faulty. Once I replaced the valves and reconnected the water lines, still no water was going to the icemaker. I disconnected the ice water line and tried to blow air through it. Blow hard as there may be water still in the line. I couldn\"t get air to pass through. Turned out the water line also was frozen on top of the freezer. I unscrewed and removed the icemaker cover to get access to the black water dispensing tube.

Stoves are automatic systems that turn the electric current on and off as needed to keep the burner at a desired temperature. They don\"t adjust the amount of electricity applied to the burner...they turn on the power full-blast or completely off. A sensor monitors the temperature and turns the power on if it is too low or turns it off if it is too high. The radiant cook top is a special kind of element that can get VERY hot VERY fast (much faster than the old kind). The temperature sensor is near the element below the glass and the element gets hotter than the hottest setting quickly and turns of the power even though the pot of food above the glass is still not super hot. So you will see the burner get red then go off several times before your food finishes cooking. This is normal. Even though it seems like it would get hot faster if it just stayed on continuously, that would actually be bad because the element would overheat and burn out. Old style burners do the same thing, but you don\"t notice it as much because they take longer to cool down and stop glowing red so it seems like they are always on when you set them to high (but they aren\"t). The same thing that makes them stay red longer, also makes them take longer to get hot so if the new element was made to be a lot slower to heat up, it would seem to stay red and it would work like the old kind (but it would take longer to cook your food).\"}\n",

Is it ok in the winter? It would be against the inside wall of the house in the garage?\", \"answer\": \"Hi Mr. Butterfield, My wife and I have our Danby Freezer in a small room in our apartment in NYC. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is constructed so well that there seems to be no reason why it would not do perfectly well in a garage. If I had a garage, I would put the Danby Freezer in it too. Also, the Freezer is Silent when it is on! It makes a very low noise after you open the door and close it, that it sounds like it is making it airtight. The Danby Freezer has heavy duty plastic sliders that move smoothly when pushing the Freezer on a floor, they also adjust in height if a floor is a little off balanced. I feel the sliders on the Danby Freezer would not move easily on a dry cement floor, unless it was painted to a durable and smooth finish. Therefore, I would protect the floor that you put the freezer on from dry cement, corrosion and dampness. I would set the Danby Freezer on top of a 1/4\" inch thick Plexiglass plastic flooring or something similar. The Danby Freezer is easy to clean and defrosts rather quickly. You can place a small one inch tall long baking pan set on the floor with the door open and any water draining out can be caught in the pan. There are no ice chunks forming inside the Freezer either. It just has a frosty coating or snowy look around the walls and elements inside the Freezer that melt off the interior when it is defrosting. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is the Best Freezer I ever had! You will not be disappointed. Best regards and Happy Holidays for the New Year! ~ Marc\"}\n",

Try t wiggle it up and down gently and to the sides and you will be able to detach it from the frame. This way you will be able to bring the valve closer to yourself and you will be able to see and access the electric plug and incoming water hose and out coming water hose. So, unplug the plug that supplies the voltage to the old valve by squeezing the \"locks\" on the plug. The plug unplugs similarly to the telephone line from the phone outlet or network cable. Keep in mind that the plug might be stuck. So, you may want to move it to the sides gently. If it does not come out it may mean that you are not squeezing it right (find that release latch). Then you need to take off the incoming water supply hose and outcoming water hose. One of them can be twisted off using adjustable wrench while the other (thinner one) has a wire based spindle (I hope I call it right), which secures the hose on the valve. Some remaining water will come out. So, it is a good idea to have a towel in that area to capture that water before disconnecting the hoses. Then you do everything in reverse using the new valve. Make sure that the thin hose fits all the way on the new valve and is secured with the wire spindle again. This may require some effort to do it. Also when you put the thick hose back be gentle and do not over tighten the nut of the hose.\"}\n",

The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn\"t, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I\"ve had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren\"t really clean at all. For me, obtaining a spin dryer was the key to the whole process. You need to see the water being released from the cloths to decide if they need rinsed another time! Hope this helps. :-)\"}\n",

Check if you are getting 24V AC coming up to the humidistat. The solenoid for the water should be closed unless the blower motor comes on. The transformer is hooked directly at the blower board for aux power 115V. Check your manual for the diagram. If it\"s blowing the breaker, the blower board is probably detecting a problem with the step down transformer 115 to 24 AC. I\"d be checking there. The humidistat acts like a light switch and that\"s just a simple circuit, open or closed. When you turn the knob you can hear it click, that\"s opening and closing the circuit to directly to the water solenoid. If the solenoid is stuck open, the solenoid is probably blown. The people who installed ours (before we bought the house) hooked it up without the 24V AC step down. 115V directly to the solenoid and poof it\"s gonna blow.

The only possible exception is if your bearing needs only grease, which means damage is being done but slowly.

There\"s some inefficiency in the induction mechanism, but I\"d guess this is less than the inefficiency of heating the air and whatnot around a conventional electric element. (3) I wouldn\"t worry about your electric bill. It\"s not going to be noticeably different than conventional electric, and, even if you are blazing away at 6000 watts (4 burners going full) you are looking at less than $1/hour at the worst of USA electric rates.

Cast iron, enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible (But not all types - for instance, All-Clad\\\"s MC2 line, which is made of aluminum and stainless steel, is not induction compatible). Aluminum, copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties. To tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible, hold a magnet to the bottom. If it clings, the cookware will work on an induction cooktop. Also, many manufacturers have started putting a n \"induction compatible\" symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they\\\"ll note compatibility on their packaging. The symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil. If you have an induction cooktop, but a favorite piece of cookware doesn\\\"t work on it, don\\\"t fret - Mauviel makes a product called the Mauviel Induction Disc (Compare Prices), which can be placed on the cooktop under the pan; the heating reaction will then heat the contents of the pan.

The Sabbath feature may only be used with the BAKE pad. The oven temperature may be set higher or lower after setting the Sabbath feature (the oven temperature adjustment feature should be used only during Jewish Holidays), however the display will not visibly show or provide any audible tones indicating whether the change occurred correctly. Once the oven is properly set using Bake with the Sabbath feature active, the oven will remain continuously ON until cancelled. This will override the factory preset 12-Hour Energy Saving feature. If the oven light will be needed during the Sabbath, press Oven light pad before activating the Sabbath feature. Once the oven light is turned ON and the Sabbath feature is active, the oven light will remain ON until the Sabbath feature is turned OFF. If the oven light needs to be OFF, be sure to turn the oven light OFF before activating the Sabbath feature. IMPORTANT NOTES: It is not advised to attempt to activate any other program feature other than BAKE while the Sabbath feature is active. ONLY the following key pads will function after setting the Sabbath feature; UP or DOWN ARROW, BAKE, START & CLEAR/OFF pads. ALL OTHER KEYPADS will not function once the Sabbath feature is properly activated. To Program the Oven to Begin Baking Immediately & activate the Sabbath feature 1. Be sure that the clock is set with the correct time of day. 2. Place the food in the oven. 3. Press Bake pad. \"---\" will appear, \"UPPER\" and \"bake \" will flash in the display. 4. Press the Up or Down arrow pad until the desired temperature appears. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" will flash in the display. 5. Press Start pad or wait 5 seconds. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" stop flashing and the icon will appear in the display. 6. If you desire to set the oven control for a Timed Bake or Delayed Start Bake do so at this time. If not, skip this step and continue to step 7. Refer to the Timed Bake (complete steps 6-8) / Delayed Start Bake (complete steps 6-11) section for complete instructions. Remember the oven will shut down after using Timed Bake or Delay Start Bake and therefore may only be used once during the Sabbath/Jewish Holidays. The maximum Delayed Start Bake time is 11 hours & 59 minutes. 7. The oven will turn ON and begin heating.\"}\n",

The life of the carbon block media is dependent mostly on your specific water quality. In other words, the worse your input water is, the less it will last. Still, even this is an oversimplification as different types of contaminate will effect the carbon media differently. This is all to say that this particular filter may only last 4 months if your property is using a non-municipal water source (i.e. well water). Perhaps if your use is so irregular, maybe looking into one of the more simple, standard, 10 or 20\" filter housings would be best. Big box hardware stores will usually have 10\" carbon block or GAC filters in stock and you could simply change the filter at any time. In any case I would recommend changing out the filter prior to first use after its sat for 8 months unused. Carbon block filters, even ones with anti-bacteria additives, can build up dangerous amounts of bacteria given enough time (and I think 8 months is more than enough). Carbon filters that have sat in stale water for that long should be changed out (and filter housings cleaned with bleach if applicable) prior to consuming any water from that system.\"}\n",

Thus if you are fitering water from a well it would reduce the radon due to reduced particles. Not because it can capture gases.

After reading the other responses, I have to say that I do NOT agree with them. I have had this machine since May 2013. I have NEVER had any issues with it. I do 5 to 8 loads of laundry every weekend. Never had a breakdown, never had clothes \"get holes in them\", never had clothes \"disappear\". I use the Regular Light, Casual Light, and Delicate cycles mostly. Handles a large loads like towels (8 large) just fine on the \"super\" water setting on the Normal Light cycle. Same goes for large loads of jeans (8 pairs) Takes just under an hour for the light cycles to finish, and less with the Delicate. The loads get cleaned well. The lid does lock, but only after the washer has finished filling and the cycle begins. Lid locks are now standard on ALL new washing machines per Federal safety law. I follow the manufacturers instructions and use the washer as it was intended using common sense that dictates to NEVER overload a clothes washer as to not cause undo stress on the machine or your laundry. Another thing to know is that this washer has a standard agitator in the middle of the basket. There is a similar model to this one that is a High Efficiency machine that does not have an agitator and that machine gets a lot of bad reviews as well. I have found that some comments for this machine are really pertaining to that other machine. To be fair, I have owned the washer for under a year, and there have been some comments that this machine starts having problems after a year\"s time. So I\"ll just have to see about that and cross that bridge IF I get to it. On a side note, I have the matching 7.0 Gas Dryer and it is a VERY GOOD dryer. Simple to use and dries our laundry effectively. I hope this answer helps you. Thank you\"}\n",

The two blend so well I thought the RO tap had gold flakes also. However it doesn\"t. It appears to have very small particle size mica in the coating. On cars, the mica would give the coating a subtle sparkle versus aluminum which can be small particle size giving the subtle reflectiveness or the in your face large particle aluminum that sparkles not just that little shimmer. Taking into account the sparkle/shimmer effect of mica and aluminum flake it would easily be an industry match since untrained eyes cannot pick up the minute color differences.

Which filter should I use on the washing machine cold water inlet line?\", \"answer\": \"This requires a multifaceted answer. First of all, how large is the sediment your well draws in? These filters are available in several different screen or mesh filter sizes. If it is sandy, you need to compare the size of the sand to the micron size of the filter element. I\"d say this is the most important research that you need to do. Next I\"d ask how much sand gets drawn in say daily, then over the course of a week. Thus could be determined by how much sand is in your toilet tanks, (when you take the lid off and look inside); then how often do you clean the screens on the washer? Lastly, do you see sand in the faucet arreaters? If the answer is a great deal to any of the above questions, I would advise you to get a filter which is one pipe size larger then then waterline coming from your pressure pump/ inlet to your house. This will allow a longer time between flushing intervals of the filter. I have used them in this application in the past, with great results for our customers. If it is installed correctly, the drain on the bottom would be run to the outside,or a nearby drain. Be sure to install a union on the drain line to allow for occasional disassembly. When the filter shows signs of being clogged- sediment in the bottom, color in the screen; then you flush it out for 1-2 minutes, until clear. I hope this helps you.

Off course one would not have a valid indicator gauge, but adding a reminder to change filters every six months on one\"s smart phone could easily fix that! Finally, I would not run any of these refrigeratoirs with a filter very long. The filter has two purposes the first to keep dust and debrie from accumulating on the internal condensing coils and secondly to eliminate refigerator oders using the activated charcoal.

However, the loudest part is actually quite loud, and lasts maybe 30 seconds. The first time I heard it, I thought something was wrong with the washer, but after talking to a technician, was assured it was normal. I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly. This sound of water hitting the tub is startling, and probably child-waking loud if it\"s near their room.\"}\n",

Also in my washer, the \"new\" suspension part was a little different (well, more like improved). I\\\"m not sure about your Kenmore Washer, but I installed a new \"improved\" wash plate in my Whirlpool, and it seems to help reduce some of the twisting of clothing (the new impeller has three tall/long and three small \"blades\" and they are all narrow, the old impeller had three large/wide raised areas). Bottom line, my washer is as good as new, no more banging and \"OL\" codes. It was well worth the effort to save the big bucks of having someone come out... I used Google to find a service manual for my washer, it had some better info on how to open the washer, there were some self-help videos on Youtube as well. Best of luck!!!\"}\n",

Simply, if the external temperature in the garage or storage area drops below the setpoint that would normally turn on the fridge compressor, the fridge will not start and the temperature in the freezer portion can rise to the temperature of the external temperature, i.e., above the freezing point, and well above the recommended storage temperature of the freezer. The device is a little heater coil that imposes an artificially warmer temperature on the refrig temperature controller that \"fools\" it into thinking that it must turn on to preserve the cooling in both sections of the fridge\"}\n",

I believe so! Being single and on a tight budget this has come in very handy! My apartment has my water and electric included in the rent so I purchased this washer and a spinner as well. I don\"t have to lug my laundry to the laundry room, hope I have enough money to wash and dry, nor do I have to worry about any of my clothes being stolen. The only small flaw that I have found this to have is that if you have thick plush towels the size of beach towels, it will not work correctly as the weight of the towel is too heavy for this, even if you just wash one at a time. I only have two such towels that I use when I go to the pool and all my other towels are the standard size and those I can wash two at a time. when it is time to wash my comforters which right now I am not using until winter time I will have to go to the laundry mat to wash those. But back to the plush towels, I just wash those by had in the kitchen sink and rinse them then I put them in the spinner and they will come out almost dry. I have gotten my monies worth on this product as I wash every week and I even wash my queen size bed sheets, flat and fitted in this washer, one at a time, of course of it beats them getting stolen from the washer in the laundry mat and having to buy new ones! I have also bought a grey colored hose from home depot to use to fill the washer faster with water because the hose it comes with is too small and it takes forever. I have only spent $6.00 for the hose and I have used both powder and also liquid detergent in this washer. If you like powder, fill washer first then add the powder and stir so the powder can dissolve, then add the close. It\"s just a little extra work but I would do it than spend $10 a week and having to sit there and wait for the clothes to wash, this way while I wash, I can do other house work or watch tv because once I don\"t hear the timer anymore then I know it stopped. I hope this helps! :) One more thing, if you can find a small table to sit it on, I have a small table that is lower than the sink but so this way when it\"s time to let the water out I just unhook the attached hose into the tub and let it drain. I don\"t even squeeze the excess water out of the clothes because you don\"t have to use more than a tablespoon of detergent. I just put clean water and set the timer to 15 minutes and let it rinse, then I let the water out again, take the clothes out and put it in the spinner and set that timer to two minutes and my clothes is clean and almost dry. I hang them to dry on hangers on this clothes rack and 30 minutes later, my clothes is dry. The thickness of the clothes depends on the time. I also set the clothes near the A/C vent so it dries quicker.\"}\n",

It just slips onto it. If it doesn\"t fit your sink (it fits most sinks), then you could simply pour half gallon pitchers of water into it till you get it about 3/4 full. Put clothes in first and then fill it. When the wash cycle is over, place the drain house in the sink and let it drain and then refill it for the rinse cycle. Six minutes seems to get our clothes really clean. Then 3 minutes for the rinse cycle. Less time because you have less clothing in it than with a full size washer. Overfilling the machine with too many clothes makes agitation (movement of machine to clean) impossible. Overfilling with water will cause some water to leak out the drain hose which is hooked in an upward position during wash and rinse cycles to keep it from prematurely draining. Machine fits pretty easily on the counter next to sink. You need only a small amount of laundry soap for each wash. It does not spin dry the clothes. You will need to wring them out or buy a small spin dryer. You could also place the machine on a table or counter and put a bucket under it for when you need to drain it. You could fill it via a garden hose. It seems to work well with cold or warm water.\"}\n",

They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn\"t immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can\"t figure out how they might be posted here.\"}\n",

Most important will this pass a home inspection IF you sell your home one day. Use foil metal tape to secure the connections seams, available at Home depot.\"}\n",

The water coming from faucet when not connected to d/w is highly pressurized. Is this normal?\", \"answerType\": \"Y\", \"answer\": \"In a word, yes. But if you\\\"re interested in the why/how, one may consider this: standard kitchen and bathroom faucets have a device located where the water exits, called an \"aerator\", which is usually comprised of a piece of steel screen, and a couple of metal or plastic components inside. This little gadget screws into the end of the faucet, precisely where you installed the adapter for the dishwasher. The purpose of this device is to intermix the exiting water with lots of air in order to increase the volume of the liquid by generating lots of little bubbles. This is why the water coming out of most faucets appears to be white and bubbly, instead of a steady, clear, stream like you would expect to see from the end of your garden hose. A faucet with an aerator produces a more controlled and gentle stream, and because the device mixes in lots of air, less water is needed in order to produce a steady and useful flow. In other words, aerators have the cumulative effect of drastically reducing both the volume of water and the exit speed of the water at the faucet. If you have noticed a difference in water pressure after installing the adapter for this dishwasher, I would venture to guess that you had one of these devices installed (99.9% of faucets do have one) and that you removed it in order to install the dishwasher adapter. So in summation, the good news is that if all my assumptions about your circumstance so far are correct, what you\\\"re experiencing is normal. The bad news (if it can be called bad?) is that you have to put up with a slightly more powerful, less ruley, stream of water coming out of your faucet. In that sense, it does represent a trade-off of sorts, however, it should also be pointed out that many people remove the aerators from the kitchen faucet on purpose, for the express purpose of achieving the higher pressure and flow that you\\\"re experiencing. Attempting to install the dishwasher adapter to the end of the aerator will not work because the dishwasher adapter will prevent any air from being drawn in to the aerator. If your faucet pressure is so high that it is a problem to use, the best advice would be to adjust the valves under your sink until you attain a more desirable rate of flow. I hope this helps!\"}\n",

It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn\"t mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn\"t have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don\"t think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950\"s and 1960\"s when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don\"t have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away.\"}\n",

With sheets - a fitted & flat queen sheet can go in together, but unfortunately sometimes it seems to cause one of them to somehow get caught over the center \"swish\" piece. So I typically wash one of them & add a bunch of other small stuff. Not for washing pillows or blankets - though you could toss a throw in. It does a good job, but the thing I hate most about it is if you keep it somewhere when not in use & then wheel it to a sink to hook up to water, the wheeling isn\\\"t the most smooth in the world. This is primarily related to the leveling knob on the side, which can pop out of the frame a lot. So if your load is imbalanced with a bigger item (if ya can fit it), that helps level it, but then is a pain in the neck.

Ms Cowgirl, the Product Description says, \"This amazing instant water heater can be connected to the existing hot water piping.\" So perhaps a better explanation is that YOU cannot hook it up to American piping. If NO ONE could hook it up to American piping, it wouldn\\\"t have a 4.4-star rating. Mr Curcie, what difference does it make WHY Ms O\\\"Meara wants it hotter? A shower is not the only way people use hot water. Folks running a food truck, for instance, might need hot water over 100 to make hot tea, instant coffee, wash their utensils, etc. Using the example in the Product Description, tap water coming in at 56 will be heated 45 to 101. This is NOT hot enough for hot drinks, as 101 is only 2.4 above body temperature. Great for baby formula; not great for coffee. If the 101 water from one unit can be run through a second unit, a 45 temperature rise will yield 146 water, which IS hot enough for coffee and hot tea. The biggest problem with Amazon\\\"s Q&As is people chiming in with \"answers\" when they don\\\"t really know the answer. So how about it? Does anyone (including the seller) actually know the answer to this question?

My was an 6\" duct and I end up going to Home Depot and get a reducer that cost about $12. I love how it look but installing it was a b*tch. It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn\\\"t feel secure for me. I don\\\"t wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn\\\"t going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1/4\" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain. Even with toggle bolt I have to end reverse mount it to make it easier to screw nut into the toggle bolt.\"}\n",

Allow it to sit and hour or two unplugged, and then empty out all water you may have put in the machine. Put new water into the reservoir making certain you do not fill it above the maximum fill line. Distilled water is best, and will save you time down the road from having to clean off excessive mineral deposits from the freezing elements, but at minimum use good filtered water and not the junk that comes straight from the faucet. Next, plug the machine back in and press the power button. Do not attempt to set the clock or the timer. Ignore those buttons completely. Select your ice size (it really doesn\"t matter which one you choose just to test the machine - any size will do.) You should almost immediately hear the machine pumping water from the reservoir into the freezing chamber. It will sound like water quietly trickling and lasts a couple of seconds. If you hear that, you know the pump is working. You should also hear the compressor kick on after the water has been pumped into the freezing chamber, and if you place your hand next to the the exhaust port you ought to begin feeling slightly warmed air blowing out. Within 10 to 12 minutes your first batch of ice will be done. You hear very audibly when the machine slides the ice off the freezing elements and they tumble onto a temporary holding platform. Then you will hear the ice being raised up on the platform and pushed off of it down into the catch basket. The clattering of the ice is unmistakable. If these things do not happen within 12 to 15 minutes of when you turned the power on, something is not right with the machine. You\"ll most likely need to notify Amazon and have it replaced.\"}\n",

Part number 2 is the part you are looking at on Amazon. Remove rack from dishwasher (there is a retainer at the end of each drawer track that needs to be either removed or opened and the tray will slide out). Carefully unclip Part #11 from the rack and slide down ward until it will unclip from the rack adjuster. Mine were very brittle from age and I snapped one off. Remove second retaining clip part #12. Hard to explain how to do this, but it is not difficult. Release the middle of it, slide it upward and and it will come off. Remove the last retainer, part #9. I used a small screw driver to assist in releasing it. Next use a small screw driver to pry apart parts 8 & 10. The top part is tabbed and the bottom part snaps together so I gently pried it apart from the bottom sides (there was a small notch i could easily get into). The rack adjuster will now slide off. Do one at a time and use the other as a reference. Assembly is the reverse. Take you time - shouldn\"t take over 45-60 minutes. First side takes the longest, after you do one the other is easy. Hope this helps.\"}\n",

The lint filter is a useless, don\"t hold nothing! Please I need help with the lint.\", \"answer\": \"I\"ve had this machine for over a year, it works great but if you have clothes that tend to shed a lot you will have lint issues. in this machine it only takes a few minutes to was clothes. It is not like the regular washers. As a rule of thumb if it is an item being washed just because I wore it once I use the three minute cycle, if I wore it outside and it got dirty I adjust the time accordingly. Lightly dirty about 6 minutes, moderate dirty 9 minutes and heavy grime 12 minutes. You will have to play with the times and degree of dirtyness. Overall these are great machines for an apartment dweller. Unfortunately they do have some limits. If you are getting a lot of lint, try decreaseing the time especially if the clothing is not grimey. Usually an item worn on one or two days just needs a light washing in this machine. I usually run the extractor for 2 minutes. Most loads take a total of 5 minutes start to finish.\"}\n",

Here are the cycle times: a) Heavy - 2:15, b) Auto - 2:09, c) Normal - 2:15, d) Express - 0:30, and e) Rinse - 0:09. If you choose one of the options, these are the cycle times (based on choosing the Normal cycle): a) Half load - 1:39, b) Delicate - 1:28, c) Sanitize - 1:48, and d) Extra Shine - 2:08. I usually use the Auto cycle with no option selected. Keep in mind that unless you wait until right before you need your dishes to wash them, the long cycle time isn\"t really an issue because the machine is so quiet that you can\"t even tell it\"s running. I\"ve had mine for three months now and would absolutely buy it again. In three months, I\"ve only had to rewash a dish perhaps twice - and it was a dish with stuck on food. Glasses come out sparkly.

Which means pick based on how much water your machine uses. So 2 models with pre defined settings for low water wash or more traditional deep models. Wash-it has 1 model for low water wash ans deep fill models. The washers wash system determines water usage not the 03 machine. They both use the same science and apply the same 03 methodology. Also, with wash it, there is a knob that you \"tune\" to ionize the water which is a great application in that based on water conditions the ability to tune the machine to the proper ionization level will ensure your machine properly ionizes the water to get your clothes clean.

Thus the range top has edges that form a 3/4 inch flange over the counter-top so that cooking spills do not leak down the sides. The counter top opening therefore must conform to the size required by the range (both width and height). Do not confuse \"slide in\" with \"drop in\" Make sure your counter height and width conform to the required spec or that you can alter it to bring it into spec. Ours fit in perfectly and my wife is overjoyed with it. Google \"slide in vs drop in\" in if you are confused over the difference between them. Also make sure that all of your cookware has enough ferrous (iron) material to allow a magnet to stick firmly to the base or the induction range will not work with it. Ours heats a proper saucepan filled with water to a full boil in less then two minutes. Its very responsive. I would not recommend this range to be used without a counter-top at each of its sides. The glass cook-top would have exposed edges that normally lie upon the counter-top and are therefore well protected from possible physical strikes resulting in consequent damage or breakage. Additionally the sides, while painted, are not designed to be exposed to view such as a standard range sitting at the end of a counter with one side exposed to view where a finished surface on the side of the range is desirable.\"}\n",

I will answer your question, though ... by explaining how I use it because I have gone through quite a bit of trial and error, and now set it up in the best way that works for me. First I get the lid to a large plastic tote bins that I have. ( Something you can find at probably every dollar store, Walmart etc ) and lay it TOP DOWN in my bathtub. This prevents the water from submerging the bottom of the machine in any way. Then, I fill the washer side ( making sure the dial is set on WASH first ) using the hand held shower head I have. It works just fine. I don\"t need to use any fancy hoses, levers, etc. I know a lot of people out there do that. This works best for me. As for soap, I either dilute a laundry pod ( as I have a bunch of them anyway ) in SIX CUPS of water ( you will have TONS left over ) and use 1 TEASPOON of that, per load .. or one teaspoon of regular liquid laundry soap. I usually turn on the machine about half a second just to see suds in the water.. I don\"t think it\"s needed though. Now, this is what I do per clothing item per load: ( for two people living in my home ) - NO MORE then 5-6 tops - NO MORE then 3-4 pants ( depending on their thickness. Jeans, two per load ) - Under clothing items, I always have a lot and I always throw them all in, but be prepared to untangle socks .. so if you do not want to do that,do your socks in small loads orput them into a THICKKKKKKKKKKKK laundry bag. ( I say thick because this machine will tear the regular small ones to absolute shreds ) - Bedding, yep, bedding ... I do the cover sheet AND the top sheet together. If you want, it can handle two pillow cases along with. I don\"t do that, I wash the pillow cases ( cuz there is four total ) with my tops. Works fine. - Do not, do not, do NOT wash ANY blankets in this machine other then baby blankets. - Towels .. now we have standard, large towels and I will NEVER again put more then two in at a time. As well, I will NEVER put more then 3/4th a teaspoon of laundry soap in with the towels because they REALLY REALLY suds up the machine. It doesn\"t matter how may times you rinse, it causes tons of suds. You will be rinsing for hours, or have to take the towels out and rinse by hand. I do all wash clothes, dish towels, hand towels together. ( Usually 7-9 pieces total ) The times I have found that work best per clothing item per load: (Seriously, screw what the numbers say or what the booklet suggests ) Tops - 5-7 minutes if you have heavily soiled tops, I don\"t see an issue with going as much as 9 minutes. Also, if they are delitcate tops, lace, etc .. 3-4 works fine. Pants - 7-10 minutes. Heavily soiled, 10 might still be enough, but go ahead and add more if they are like muddy, etc. ( In which case, you don\"t wannal oad the machine up too much with mud etc) Under clothing - I run em the full 15 minutes. Works great. Towels, 13-15. After washing is done, drain. Then refill to rinse. You have to do this or your clothes are gonna be sudsy. Go ahead and leave clothing in machine while your draining and refilling. Then, run the rinse for HALF the amount of time you just washed. Then drain the machine again, take cloths out of the wash and put into the spinner. Now, for every load, you wanna SPLIT it in half to spit. For example, if you just washed four pairs of thin pants, put two in at a time. ( The spin side is smaller anyway ) Five shirts, two first, then three next. Towels ONE AT A TIME. The hand towels and etc, I spin all at once , or split in two loads, it works fine. Then hang up or throw in dryer if you have one. Now it was dead of summer where I live when I got this and its cooled now to 80s ... our clothes take the entire day to dry, unless you got a fan blowing on it. I have hung laundry on hangers for more then ten years, so this does not bother me. I know I have said lots here but I truly love this machine. It has saved money at the laundrymat and saves energy... however, be prepared to be messing with your machine quite awhile on laundry day unless you use it for washing odds and ends. Also, I would STRONGLY advise NOT using any liquid fabric softner. I am very sensitive to the stuff personally, but can tell ya, this machine doesn\"t really get it out real well. Good luck!\"}\n",

Not too noisy either. Water usage is about 1.5-2 buckets full of water, plus what you use for rinsing. It\"s less than what you\"d use filling up your bathtub for a bath... When I use this, I use the method we used to use when I was a child and haven\"t had an automated washer. This method will save you water, too. : Fill the washer part with water. Warmer water should be used for whites. Fill up a bucket or a children size tub with colder water for rinsing. Separate your laundry by colours, and start the wash with whites. When the whites are done, twist them over the washer, so the water will stay in the washer, then put the laundry into the bucket filled for rinsing. Then put the next, darker coloured bunch of laundry into the same water in the washer. Wash it, and during that rinse you whites in the bucket, then twist or squeeze them before placing them in the spining part of the machine. Once spinned, shake the items to reduce wrinkles, then hang them on a drying rack or wire or hanger to dry. Same to do with the darker colours. As you get ahead with the process, the water temperature will be reduced as well by time. You\"ll save water, gas or electricity to heat the water and probably time as well. As said earlier, for one wash for all or most colours you use less water than using by having a bath or a long shower. Obviously if it is more than one person\"s laundry, you might need a bit more water and time, but the amount of water used will be still less than having a bath each. I hope this helps. And one more thing. Sometimes landlords don\"t want washers installed in apartments, because of lack of space or because they are afraid of leakage. I can assure you that you can spill more water by handwashing your stuff at home in the bathroom than by using this washer carefully, not to mention that those landlords would not think of such options as this portable washer. I\"d might go to my landlord and ask for permission, rather than hiding it and doing laundry secretly. But all circumstances differ as all people are different.\"}\n",

There is a popular misconception that there is one Mylar film and the thicker, the better. Actually, there are many kinds of Mylar films which consist of layers of different materials that serve different purposes. Mylar itself is a transparent member of the polyester family that is remarkably strong. The Mylar in this film has a bursting strength of 69 pounds per square inch so it can withstand a lot of abuse. In order to make the film a protective barrier to oxygen, a foil layer is added. (oxygen cannot go through glass or metal) This foil layer can be disturbed by folding, moving or filling the bag and you can sometimes see a scratch or a separation during regular use but these are not holes in the film and do not significantly effect the performance of the bag. Mylar bags from Pack Fresh are made here in Southern California and have never been shipped until you buy them. That is how we can afford to compete with the other discount \"mylar\" that comes from China. There are some enlightening Washington Post articles that should make it clear why American-made products such as those from Pack Fresh are superior.

Mylar is one of the toughest flexible materials ever created. The film we use to make these can take the weight of two and a half cinder blocks EVERY square inch... and folding does not hurt it. (Still, we do ship orders of 3 or more in a large box as long as it is not Fulfilled by Amazon) But Mylar film is transparent. It looks metallic because a separate layer of aluminum has been added to the Mylar. Normal use, even filling it or moving it, will cause tiny breaks in the foil layer that you may sometimes see if you hold it to the light - but don\"t worry, they are not holes. This happens with all Mylarfoil films and their barrier properties are not significantly effected . I\"m glad you didn\"t forget your best friend!
